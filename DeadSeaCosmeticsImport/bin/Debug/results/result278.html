The items included in this gift set are a body lotion, a body butter and shower gel, to make your skin feel its best, and they are perfumed with a unique scent made in southern France, Gardenia Vanilla. This makes it smell floral, somewhat fruity and a bit woody, a choice you couldn't  if you tried. As such, these cosmetic products make great gifts.
