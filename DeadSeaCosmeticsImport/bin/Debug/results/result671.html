Who would have thought that the Argan tree in the south of Morocco would turn out to be so good for your hair?  For centuries, local women have hand-pressed the nuts from Argan trees to produce an oil, which is primarily thought of as a healthy supplement to your diet.  However, it is now proving to be an incredibly valuable ingredient in the quest for healthier hair. 
 
So, what is Argan oil and what makes it so great?  In short, it is packed full of nutrients such as vitamin E and other items.  The anti-oxidants found in these nutrients are critical in helping strengthen hair follicles which are the key to healthy, glistening hair.  This serum enjoys a gentle fragrance and is a blend of not only vitamin E, but also pro-vitamin B5, Dead Sea Minerals, Sea Buckthorn oil, Argan oil, jojoba oil and flax oil.  The serum is particularly effective in treating, moisturizing and repairing hair which has been damaged due to chemical processes including dying, curling and bleaching.  You don’t need to use much Argan oil serum for best results.  Just a few drops used daily on moist or dry hair and you will soon see the difference.
