Health and Beauty Dead Sea Minerals has created a perfect peel-off mask (as opposed to a peeling mask, in which the mask is massaged off). Enriched with Dead Sea minerals, this peel-off mask removes dirt and exfoliates the skin, leaving a healthy glow.
Impurities are lifted away! The peel-off action stimulates the skin, gets the blood flowing, and restores a look of energy and freshness. Third, the peel-off mask firms the skin tissue. Ensure that your skin stays rejuvenated and revitalized and looks young and supple.
Perfect as an after-work pick-me-up, this mask is easy to use. Once a week, apply a thin layer to clean, dry skin. Avoid the skin around the eyes. Wait approximately 10 mintues until the mask dries. Peel off, starting at the chin and moving toward the forehead. After the mask, it's recommended to freshen up with facial toner and moisturizer.
