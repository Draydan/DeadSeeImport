The dead  sea is famous for being so dense in minerals and salts that you can't sink in it. This interesting effect of the water's density has painted the images of floating bathers comfortably reading a paper or a book into the world's eyes but those same minerals can be utilized to create unique cosmetics and products with a much more mineral and vitamin rich quality than any other similar cosmetics would. And Sea of spa is on the very top in terms of quality.
