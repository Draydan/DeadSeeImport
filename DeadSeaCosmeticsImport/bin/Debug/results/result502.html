The vitamin and mineral complex in "Canaan's" cosmetic and spa products is unique and make them mighty!
 
The human body cannot synthesize minerals in any way, therefore you  must supplement them. The usual ways to get them are in  foods and vitamin supplements but the body can also get them from  such products as those offered in the "Canaan" line of cosmetics.
Canaan products contain patented mix of Plant Extracts known as CSE Complex™, the healing powers of these plants have been known since the dawn of man. 
The developers of "Canaan" Series have researched and found three medicinal plants which are particularly effective in the treatment of skin. These are Hypericum Perforatum, Lanceolata, and Plantago Lea. These are the cornerstones of CSE Complex™
