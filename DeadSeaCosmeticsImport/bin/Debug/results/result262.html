<tr><td>Dead Sea Cosmetics Brands</td><td>Anti Cellulite Minerals and Seaweed 125gr, Dead Sea Soap</td><td>$8.95</td><td>Get rid of cellulite...fast!  With Anti Cellulite Soap with Dead Sea Minerals and Seaweed from Sea of Spa Cosmetics.  Dead Sea Minerals will dehydrate the area and will firm and tighten the skin giving you a smoother appearance.  </td><td>Define and Refine your skin.  This Anti cellulite Soap with Dead Sea Minerals and Seaweed is meant to be used to massage the affected area.  Cellulite occurs because of fibrous bands in the skin that hold it to the underlying muscle.  Fat cells lie between those bands.  When the fat cells accumulate they push up against the skin as the cords are pulling down.  The result is the dimpling that we see in cellulite.   Massaging helps to break down those cords and the result is smoother-looking skin.  In addition, the seaweed helps reduce the appearance of fat cells.   The Dead Sea Minerals are the key ingredient which, due to the special properties inherent in them, help your body get rid of toxins by breaking down deposits trapped directly below the skin’s surface.  Your skin then appears softer and smoother than ever before.
