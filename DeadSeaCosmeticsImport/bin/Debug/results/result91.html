However, it just got much easier thanks to this psoriasis shampoo, which unleashes the healing properties of Dead Sea minerals.</td><td>Although it can affect skin across the body, psoriasis is perhaps most common on the scalp, where it can be particularly itchy and irritating. 
So, there is no better remedy with which to combat this annoyance than with this psoriasis shampoo.  The secret is that this shampoo is formed from a combination of Dead Sea minerals, which are renowned for their soothing qualities.  Elements such as magnesium and potassium help to tackle sensitive scalps, which are particularly susceptible to psoriasis. The shampoo itself provides relief from psoriasis, as it is a gentle formula, containing 25% natural oils and other moisturizing agents, giving you greater comfort.  However, even without the healing properties themselves, this is a wonderfully gentle shampoo.  With a formula which is rich in natural oils, it is able to nourish hair and strengthen its roots in its own right.  Although this psoriasis shampoo acts strongly against skin irritation, it is still suitable for use on children.  Given its natural ingredients, there is no danger of causing harm and therefore it’s recommended for use at all ages.  So, whether it is relief from psoriasis or a soothing shampoo that you are looking for, try this unique Dead Sea product.
