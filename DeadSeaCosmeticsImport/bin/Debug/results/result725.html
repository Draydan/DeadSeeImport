For women and men50 ml</td><td>The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and delicate, and thus tends to show wear and tear easily. Sun damage, prolonged exposure to air conditioning and pollution, and the natural aging process all take their toll on the area around the eyes.
This high-quality, intensive anti-aging dead sea eye serum from Health and Beauty Dead Sea Minerals is designed to combat these effects and keep you looking bright-eyed. The eye gel features a light, easily absorbed texture. As soon as it's applied, the skin surrounding the eyes gets a lift. Make-up can be applied directly after the rejuvenating eye gel is applied, but even without makeup, you'll notice a difference - reduced swelling and puffiness and reduced dark circles.
The serum contains nourishing minerals from the Dead Sea, as well as aloe vera and chamomile extracts to relax and soothe the skin and carrot oil, olive oil, and rosehip oil, which suffuse and smooth the skin, pushing out wrinkles and sag. Women or men concerned about their eyes giving away their age can turn to this simple, effective moisturizing eye serum. An eye-opening development from H&B!
Instructions: In the morning, use the pads of the fingers to GENTLY massage in gel (use a dabbing motion). For best results, also use the gel before bed, followed by moisturizing cream.
