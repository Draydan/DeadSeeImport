Just rub in this Argan oil hair mask and see the difference.</td><td> 
It is the next big thing in skin and hair treatment.  Argan oil is indigenous to Morocco’s southern deserts, where kernels are picked from the Argan tree, containing a variety of healthy and healing elements.  So, what is Argan oil?  Well, it is best known as the oil which is pressed from nuts by Berber women and is commonly used as an alternative to olive oil.
 
However, another lesser known benefit to this Moroccan oil is its use in skin and hair treatment.  Because Argan oil is rich in many nutrients, including anti-oxidants, it can do wonders for your hair.  If you suffer from damaged hair, thanks to chemical treatments, coloring or styling, you can soon put things right with this hair mask.  It combines Argan oil with olive oil, jojoba oil, silicone, vitamins A, E and B5, and Dead Sea minerals from Israel.  The effect is increased blood circulation to the scalp and ultimately stronger hair follicles.  The result is quite simply healthier, shinier hair that is easier to manage.  After a wash, just rinse out the excess water and work in a generous amount of Argan oil hair mask and then wash it out after about five minutes.

The benefits of using this unique Moroccan oil are there for all to see.  Argan oil is the next big thing in hair care.  It has been developed from the kernels of the Argan tree, found in the deserts of south Morocco.  For centuries, its use has been restricted to the region in which it is found. Now though, word of its famed properties is spreading and the wonders of Argan oil are available in a variety of products.
 
This hair cream for example, is packed full of important nutrients.  The Argan oil itself is combined with pro-vitamin B5, vitamin E, almond oil, grape seed oil, and Dead Sea minerals to produce a moisturizing formula.  It is especially useful for curly, dried or colored hair which is difficult to manage.  This Argan oil cream helps separate tough curls and gives them a healthy, fresh look.  It also helps prevent split ends with silicones that seal the hair ends.  Not only are the results outstanding, but using the product couldn’t be simpler.  Just massage it onto your hair, from the scalp towards the ends.  Don’t rinse it out, simply leave the Argan oil to work its magic and watch the results.
