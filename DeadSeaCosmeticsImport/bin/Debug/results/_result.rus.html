In addition, Health and Beauty's face cream features extract of Sea Buckthorn (Obliphica) – a plant that grows by the sea, nourished by the salt spray, and is rich in linoleic acid, tocopherols, tocotrienols and carotenoids. Sea Buckthorn oil has traditionally been used to treat skin conditions and nourish the skin and is a popular element in plant-based beauty products.

The secret to Argan oil’s success is the wealth of nutrients that it contains.  It’s a particularly rich source of vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are great for skin and help to bring blood circulation to the scalp, strengthening hair follicles.  So, if you want to take better care of your skin or are looking for healthier, silkier hair, then what is known as Moroccan oil is the answer.  It moisturizes, heals and some even say that it prevents aging.  What more could you possibly want from the natural product which is Argan oil?
