Nothing can compare to this unique blending of minerals, vitamins and healing plant extracts found in the facial, body and spa products of "Canaan" Series. The Human  body cannot synthesize minerals in any way, therefore you must supplement them. The usual ways to get them are in foods and vitamin supplements but the body can also get them from such products as those offered in the "Canaan" line of cosmetics.
Canaan products contain the patented mix of Plant Extracts known as CSE Complex™, the healing powers of these plants have been known since the dawn of man. 
The developers of "Canaan" Series have researched and found three medicinal plants which are particularly effective in the treatment of skin. These are Hypericum Perforatum, Lanceolata, and Plantago Lea. These are the cornerstones of CSE Complex™
