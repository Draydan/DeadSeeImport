Originating from the dusty deserts of Morocco, Argan oil is set to become a global best-seller.  For centuries, Berber women in the south of Morocco have plucked nuts from the Argan tree and hand-pressed them into oil.  This can be used as a healthy and tasty alternative to olive oil in your diet.  However, all the talk today is about the incredible cosmetic benefits of Argan oil.  Quite simply, if you’re looking to take better care of your skin or to repair damaged hair, look no further than Moroccan oil.  It is a totally natural product and so the effects can only be positive.
 
The secret to Argan oil’s success is the wealth of nutrients that it contains.  It’s a particularly rich source of vitamin E and essential fatty acids, which are great for skin and help to bring blood circulation to the scalp, strengthening hair follicles.  So, if you want to take better care of your skin or are looking for healthier, silkier hair, then what is known as Moroccan oil is the answer.  It moisturizes, heals and some even say that it prevents aging.  What more could you possibly want from the natural product which is Argan oil?
