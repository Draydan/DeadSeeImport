The benefits of Argan oil are numerous.  Although this natural oil, which originates from Morocco is best known as a food supplement, an alternative to olive oil, it is also an incredible treatment for damaged hair.  The oil itself originates from the Argan tree in the south of Morocco, although they are now also being grown in Israel’s harsh deserts.  This healing oil is the product of Argan kernels, which are traditionally ground by Berber women.
 
The result is an oil rich with nutrients.  Among these are a host of anti-oxidants, which boast untold benefits for hair which has been subjected to excessive dying, hair-drying or the elements of wind and rain. The benefits of this Moroccan oil mean that the process of dry, thinning or splitting hair can be stopped. 
 
One of the best products to harness Argan oil is this hair softener, which is blended with grape seed oil, nettle and rosemary extract, Aloe Vera and of course Argan oil.  What’s more, it couldn’t be easier to use.  After washing your hair, simply squeeze out the excess water and shampoo.  Then massage the softener into your hair, without touching the scalp, wait for a minute and rinse again.
