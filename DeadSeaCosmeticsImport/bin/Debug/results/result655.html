The dead sea, Israel, is well known to not only be the lowest point on earth, but also one of the most unique. Famous for its water being so densely packed with minerals and vitamins that things float on it rather than sinking, the dead sea can easily be utilized for those minerals and vitamins via cosmetics, bringing the body the minerals and vitamins vital to its health.
Sea of Spa has always excelled in this regard, and with over 15 years of quality dead sea cosmetics, now they are on the very top of the game.
