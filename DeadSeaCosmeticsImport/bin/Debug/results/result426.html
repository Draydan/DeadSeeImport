The collagen mask features concentrated ingredients to combat aging and leave skin smooth and supple and young-looking.+Active ingredients include collagen, antioxidant vitamins A, B5, C, and E, nourishing Dead Sea minerals, and all-natural plant extracts. Oils in this firming mask include chamomile, papaya, grape seed, jojoba, olive oil, and almond oil. Aloe Vera enriches and soothes the skin.+Use: Apply a thin layer of mask to clean, dry skin (avoiding the eyes.) Wait 10 minutes, then rinse with warm water. It is recommended to follow the mask with Health and Beauty's Collagen Firming Face Cream.
