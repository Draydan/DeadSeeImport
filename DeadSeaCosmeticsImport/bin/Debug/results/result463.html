It is the next big thing in skin and hair treatment.  Argan oil is indigenous to Morocco’s southern deserts, where kernels are picked from the Argan tree, containing a variety of healthy and healing elements.  So, what is Argan oil?  Well, it is best known as the oil which is pressed from nuts by Berber women and is commonly used as an alternative to olive oil.
 
However, another lesser known benefit to this Moroccan oil is its use in skin and hair treatment.  Because Argan oil is rich in many nutrients, including anti-oxidants, it can do wonders for your hair.  If you suffer from damaged hair, thanks to chemical treatments, coloring or styling, you can soon put things right with this hair mask.  It combines Argan oil with olive oil, jojoba oil, silicone, vitamins A, E and B5, and Dead Sea minerals from Israel.  The effect is increased blood circulation to the scalp and ultimately stronger hair follicles.  The result is quite simply healthier, shinier hair that is easier to manage.  After a wash, just rinse out the excess water and work in a generous amount of Argan oil hair mask and then wash it out after about five minutes.
